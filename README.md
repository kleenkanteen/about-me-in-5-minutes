I'll do a thorough character analysis of myself in this article.

## My motto: Be bold, be curious. 

Don't be afraid to voice your disagreement, concerns, and in asking questions. Fortune favors the bold.

Both within university classes and in my first ever internship as a full stack developer I was vocal in constantly asking questions. I'm someone who doesn't care what others think. Constructive feedback I take notice of, of course. But caring about what others think when doing something isn't something I do usually. Life's about making my own beliefs and charting my own path; not following others.

Everyone has their talents, things they are especially good at. Learned talents in this case, things they have practiced a lot and improved on. I have 4: being bold, being resourceful, being curious, and being a debater. You'll see examples of these throughout the article.

## A little more about me
- Ideas - I'm someone with a lot of ideas. I have a lot of .md note files in a program called Obsidian, and whenever I think of a solution to a problem I face or see in my day to day, by making a website/app/chrome extension, I write it down in my ideas.md file so I don't forget. I have about 40-50 right now. Wish I could make each idea as I get them but there's only so many hours in a day. 

- Minimalism - quality over quantity. Better friends over more. Conciseness in speech, although as someone who likes detail, it can be hard to speak consisely at times. I aim for less physical possessions. Take Ikea for example. From their products to the outside packaging, everything is beautifully simple. 

- I read a quote from an experienced developer, "If you asked me to characterize my feelings about years spent building software in one phrase, I would have to quote Eugene Meyer's law "It Is Simple To Make Things Complex, But Complex To Make Things Simple". So minimalism and programming make a beautiful marriage.

- Never Bored - I cannot remember the last time I got bored. There is always an article on my to-read list or a course on my to-learn list. The amount of things I want to read and learn outstrip available time.

- Social - I'm genuinely curious about others and this makes interesting conversations. I do this a lot with friends and people I meet. One friend said I'm like a journalist, lol.

- History nerd - Passionate about history because it gives me perspective on why things are the way they are now. How nations formed. How people used to live. How technologies developed. Youtube is a gold mine for them. Voices of the past is one of my favorites since it has detailed first person accounts, as if you are there in their shoes.

- Organized - I like to extract order from chaos. To make things in a logical manner, physically and virtually. It's one way I acheive efficiency. Biggest example - I make my bed every morning lol. And you'll see another concrete example in my desk setup below.

## My Desk Setup

My desk:

My keyboard:

As you can see with my unusual keyboard and layout, I can be a nonconformist. To innovate, you must think different, from the first principles.

For my key layout, I iterated and improved it around 15 times before settling on this one. I don't use QWERTY also, I switched right as I got the keyboard in July 2021. I use Colemak-DH because my fingers move about 50% of the distance due to the most common keys being on the home row. The full analysis the creator wrote is pretty complex. Here's my custom layout:

A graph over 5 months of my speed increase when I switched from QWERTY to Colemak-DH. I find it interesting I can see long term progress:

There's several points of efficiency in this layout but to keep in short it has 2 layers. The default first layer is at the top of the pic and the second is at the bottom of the pic. The second layer is activated with the MOD 1 key on the far right when it is held down like shift. Arrows keys under my left thumb are a treat for programming and typing in general. My arms don't gets displaced like a normal keyboard, only my fingers move, so it's very ergonomic to use.

If you are interested, I wrote an in depth article of my keyboard, key layout, and shorcuts I use: [link](https://medium.com/@irisman/the-peak-programming-keyboard-and-key-layout-57cded217236)

2 quotes to end it off:

This ones about simplicity, which relates me to me as I like minimalism:

"Anybody can make the simple complicated. Creativity is making the complicated simple." -Charles Mingus

And this quite is about having the right values. It reminds me of the impact of open source projects with relatively little resources but such high impact because the spirit was to share and help others, for example: Linux, Git and SQLite:

"What makes a winning team, "Many U.S. sports fans agree that the greatest victory in this country’s history was when a group of unknown college kids, led by head coach Herb Brooks, stunned the Soviets 4-3 in the 1980 Winter Olympics and went on to win the gold medal in ice hockey. When asked how he assembled the team, as well as his University of Minnesota hockey teams (Brooks had taken Minnesota from a perpetual doormat to winning three Division 1 National Championships in 7 years), Brooks responded, “The key to my recruiting was that I looked for people first, athletes second. I wanted people with sound value systems because you cannot buy values. You are only as good as your values. I learned early on that you do not put greatness into people…but somehow try to pull it out.” - [https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-locker-room](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-locker-room)

Hopefully this was short enough to give a glimpse of me. Thanks for reading.
