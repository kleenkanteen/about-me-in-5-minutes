I'll do a thorough character analysis of myself in this article.

## My motto: Be bold, be curious. 

Don't be afraid to voice your disagreement, concerns, and in asking questions. Fortune favors the bold.

Both within university classes and in my first ever internship (and programming job), as a full stack developer (doing currently), I'm vocal and constantly asking questions. I'm someone who doesn't care what others think. Sure, constructive feedback I take notice of. But caring about what others think when doing something necessary isn't something I do. Requires a thick skin. Life's about making my own beliefs and charting my own path; not following others.

Everyone has their talents, things they are especially good at. Learned talents in this case, things they have practiced a lot and improved on. I have 4: being bold, being resourceful, being curious, and being a debater. Let me explain:

## Being bold
I'm outspoken. Eager to share my thoughts and also others. You'll see me in clas, 100-200 people, raising my hand and asking questions. I'm engaged. I don't mind asking, me wanting to understand it is more important to me than speaking in front of others. My desire to learn makes me bold. Same thing happens with asking questions in a class of 20-30 people taught by only a upper year student hired to help the professor do practice problems. Most people I've observed don't raise their hand to ask, even in these small 20-30 person classes. The hardest class I took in first year was math proofs, and in the 20-30 person classes, only me a and 2 others in a class of 25 ever spoke to ask a question. Based on the 4 quiz averages, many people were struggling, me included. People did not know but were either too scared or disinterested.

## Being resourceful
I can navigate the internet well, a galaxy of information and sources. I use google search queries not satisfied with the results; namely exact match, site specific and date range, sometimes the and, or, and exclusion operator. I write the search input in different ways if the initial results don't satisfy me. I know how to identify the good sources from the bad, both for learning sources and news sources. I know the right questions to ask and chart my own path to learn or achieve something. Having curiosity and a critical mindset allowed me to hone the skill of guiding myself. Especially helpful for teaching myself something and which course/youtube channel to learn from. If I want to learn react on udemy, there's 30 different courses teaching it. I don't sort through them all and compare, I look at some indicators, such as how active the instructor is in Q&A. Someone online told me instructor Q&A activity shows how much they care about their students and therefore the quality of their teaching. By honing my resourcefulness, I have chosen many good quality courses/youtube videos to learn from throughout high school and university to teach myself something. The best learning I did was outside of school because the best teachers are usually not found in school in my experience.

## Being curious
I have a insatiable curioisity and feed the beast by asking questions. 

One example of being curious: In 4th grade I took apart a battery powered dancing flower from the dollar store that also had a small solar panel on it. I took it apart to observe how it worked. What especially interested me was the small electic motor that made the flower move left and right. But I observed something I could not figure out the answer to until years later in grade 11, when I took a physics class that talked about electric motors, and I wasn't satisfied with the teacher's explanation; it didn't answer the question I had about motors when I observed the dancing flower's motor in 4th grade. I watched a few youtube videos, which did not explain well, until I stumbled upon one that finally did and it made sense.

During high school by watching youtube explanations, I learnt how complex machines worked, including a car engine, transmission, A/C, engines, toilets, pumps, etc. One youtube channel called Lesics was especially good at this, the filled the niche of intuitive and clear engineering explanations.

I enjoy reading interesting articles. Many, many hours spent doing so. I have more articles to read in my to read list that I do have time. There are some intelligent people out there with some great insights and lessons to share. You can check good ones I read in my collection [here](https://github.com/kleenkanteen/interesting-articles).

## Being a debater
If you ask my friends, they'll say I will argue about something if I disagree. This requires boldness. I'm detailed so I'll disect an argument and belief and question someone about how they got there and their sources. On youtube there's a channel I enjoy watching that does Street Epistemology. If you search up that term on youtube, first search result will bring up the guy who does it. I don't believe things blindly, I'm logically rigorous.

I only use reddit, no instagram at all, since reddit is a text heavy platform while instagram doens't even let you make text posts. On reddit I had long form convos with people on programming and philosophy with multi paragraph written responses. Society would be much better if people could debate in a logical and civilized manner.

I'm passionate about finding the truth and having evidence based beliefs, so I've deveploped my debate and questioning skills to aid me in that pursuit.

For programming in particular, complexity is overwhelming when choosing what to use to build what idea. There's always tradeoffs to be made. Having those critical analysis skills has been valuable in this regard. I know what tool to use for what job. And when a tool is overkill for a job. I've learnt to start simple and minimize complexity.

## A little more about me
- Ideas - I'm someone with a lot of ideas. I have a lot of .md note files in a program called Obsidian, and whenever I think of a solution to a problem I face or see in my day to day, by making a website/app/chrome extension, I write it down in my ideas.md file so I don't forget. I have about 40-50 right now. Time limits me. 

- Minimalism - quality over quantity. Better friends over more. Conciseness in speech, although as someone who likes detail, it can be hard to speak consisely at times. I aim for less physical possessions. Take Ikea for example. From their products to the outside packaging, everything is beautifully simple. 

- I read a quote from a experienced developer, "If you asked me to characterize my feelings about years spent building software in one phrase, I would have to quote Eugene Meyer's law "It Is Simple To Make Things Complex, But Complex To Make Things Simple". So minimalism and programming make a beautiful marriage.

- Never Bored - I cannot remember the last time I got bored. There is always an article on my to-read list or a course on my to-learn list. The amount of things I want to read and learn outstrip available time.

- Social - In the second half of third year, Dec-Apr 2022, I reached out to 15 random classmates. They were from my programming classes held online on zoom during the the pandemic so I could see their names when they talked in the zoom chat during class. These classmates were actively asking questions in class or on the class discussion board outside of class. I emailed them and arranged a zoom chat. I asked to talk about school, programming, and internships. I had interesting 1-2 hour conversations with each one, about the topics mentioned and some random things as well casually. I like asking questions and knowing about people's thoughts and perspectives.

- History nerd - Passionate about history because it gives me perspective on why things are the way they are now. How nations formed. How people used to live. How technologies innovated. Am subscribed to many high quality channels on youtube, have watched a couple hundred hours so far. Voices of the past is one of my favorites since it has detailed first person accounts.

- Organized - I like to extract order from chaos. To make things in a logical manner, physically and virtually. It's one way I acheive efficiency. Biggest example - I make my bed every morning lol. And you'll see a concrete example in my desk setup below.

## My Desk Setup

My desk:

![desk setup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67878058/184403471-63ac20ee-eca6-491b-8c44-4a7b575afe99.jpg)

My keyboard:

![keyboard v3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67878058/184403492-36d28064-54f2-4e7b-86cf-1393223dbe3b.jpg)

As you can see with my unusual keyboard and layout, I can be a nonconformist at times. I think through about things and form my own opinions. And sometimes I may look odd. But I put my values and thinking over what others believe. 

To innovate, you have to think different. Thinking from different perspectives permeates my thinking style. 

My key layout, iterated and improved it around 15 times before settling on this one, I don't use QWERTY also, I switched right I got the keyboard July 2021. I use Colemak-DH as my fingers move about 50% of the distance due to the high frequency keys being on the home row. The distance calculations I read online of the full ergonomic analysis get pretty complex:

A graph over 5 months of my speed increase when I switched from QWERTY to Colemak-DH. I find it interesting I can see long term progress:

There's several points of efficiency in this layout but to keep in short it has 2 layers. The first layer is at the top of the pic and the second is at the bottom of the pic. The second layer is activated with the MOD 1 key on the far right when it is held down like shift. Arrows keys under my left thumb are a treat for programming and typing in general. My arms don't gets displaced like a normal keyboard, only my fingers move, so it's very comfortable and ergonomic.

I wrote a in depth article of my keyboard, key layout, and shorcuts I use if you are interested: [link](https://medium.com/@irisman/the-peak-programming-keyboard-and-key-layout-57cded217236)

2 quotes to end it off:

This ones about simplicity, which relates me to me as I like minimalism:

"Anybody can make the simple complicated. Creativity is making the complicated simple." -Charles Mingus

This ones about about having the right values. It reminds me of the impact of open source projects with relatively little resources but such high impact because the spirit was to share and help others, for example, Linux, Git and SQLite:

"What makes a winning team, "Many U.S. sports fans agree that the greatest victory in this country’s history was when a group of unknown college kids, led by head coach Herb Brooks, stunned the Soviets 4-3 in the 1980 Winter Olympics and went on to win the gold medal in ice hockey. When asked how he assembled the team, as well as his University of Minnesota hockey teams (Brooks had taken Minnesota from a perpetual doormat to winning three Division 1 National Championships in 7 years), Brooks responded, “The key to my recruiting was that I looked for people first, athletes second. I wanted people with sound value systems because you cannot buy values. You are only as good as your values. I learned early on that you do not put greatness into people…but somehow try to pull it out.” - [https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-locker-room](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-locker-room)

My first article about me was a 20 minute read. Hopefully this was short enough and gave a good glimpse of me. Hope you found this interesting.
