## My motto: Be bold, be curious. 

Don't be afraid to voice your concerns or to ask questions. Fortune favors the bold.

And be curious. Not enough people ask enough questions. Too many pepole stick to the defaults when it comes to opinions or even their computer settings. “Rarely do we find people who willingly engage in hard, solid thinking. There is an almost universal quest for easy answers and half-baked solutions. Nothing pains some people more than having to think.” - Martin Luther King Jr.

## A little more about me
- Bold: not afraid to speak up. Innate within me I guess.

- Resourceful: I will ask and google to learn what I need. Helped me a lot in school when the professor (usually) can't teach well.

- Curious: I like asking questions because I like knowing what's behind the curtains :)

- Debating: I'm opioniated. I try to think of why things happen around me. And what's the ideal way to live.

- History nerd: My curiosity ties into this. I like knowing how others used to live. How our world came to be. Humans are one bloody mess.

- Ideas - I have a lot of ideas. I use Obisidan for notes with a lot of markdown files. One file for project ideas has around 100 ideas. So many ideas, so little time.

- Minimalism - quality over quantity. I buy as little as possible. What makes life good is not the material but the immaterial.

- Organized - I like order. To make things in a logical manner, physically and virtually. Simple example: I make my bad.

## My Desk Setup

My desk:

My keyboard:

As you can see with my unusual keyboard and layout, I think different. To innovate, you must think from the first principles.

For my key layout, I iterated and improved it around 15 times before settling on this one. I don't use Qwerty, I switched to another layout called Colemak-DH when I got the keyboard in July 2021. I use Colemak-DH because my fingers move about 50% of the distance due to the most common keys being on the home row. Here's my custom layout:

Here's the comparison of my most common keys on Qwerty vs. Colemak-DH:

A graph over 5 months of my speed increase when I switched from QWERTY to Colemak-DH. Interesting to see the progression:

There's several points of efficiency in this layout but to keep in short it has 2 layers. The default first layer is at the top of the pic and the second is at the bottom of the pic. The second layer is activated with the MOD 1 key on the far right when it is held down like shift. Arrows keys under my left thumb are a treat for programming and typing in general. My arms don't gets displaced like a normal keyboard, only my fingers move so it's very ergonomic to use.

If you are interested, I wrote an in depth article of my keyboard: [link](https://medium.com/@irisman/the-peak-programming-keyboard-and-key-layout-57cded217236)

2 quotes to end it off:

This ones about simplicity:

A senior dev wrote: "If you asked me to characterize my feelings about years spent building software in one phrase, I would have to quote Eugene Meyer's law "It Is Simple To Make Things Complex, But Complex To Make Things Simple". Minimalism and programming make a beautiful marriage.

And this one is about having the right values. That's why I like open source, the purpose is to share knowledge and help others:

"What makes a winning team, "Many U.S. sports fans agree that the greatest victory in this country’s history was when a group of unknown college kids, led by head coach Herb Brooks, stunned the Soviets 4-3 in the 1980 Winter Olympics and went on to win the gold medal in ice hockey. When asked how he assembled the team, as well as his University of Minnesota hockey teams (Brooks had taken Minnesota from a perpetual doormat to winning three Division 1 National Championships in 7 years), Brooks responded, “The key to my recruiting was that I looked for people first, athletes second. I wanted people with sound value systems because you cannot buy values. You are only as good as your values. I learned early on that you do not put greatness into people…but somehow try to pull it out.” - [https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-locker-room](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-locker-room)

Hope this gave a good glimpse of me. Thanks for reading.
